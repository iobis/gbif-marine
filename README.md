# gbif-marine

On 13 October 2014, a Letter of Agreement on cooperation between IOC-UNESCO/OBIS and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (www.gbif.org) was signed in which the two parties recognized the two initiatives (OBIS and GBIF) as complementary with common goals (and in particular OBISâ€™s role in Marine Biodiversity Data). Together they agreed to work towards maximizing the quantity, quality, completeness and fitness for use of marine biodiversity data, accessible through OBIS and GBIF and in particular in the development of data standards (DWC), technology (IPT), maximizing fitness for use, development of biodiversity indicators for assessments, enhance capacity through training and coordinate approaches to the global science/policy interface. 

This repository is dedicated to discuss and solve any issues related to re-initating the data flow from OBIS to GBIF and vice versa. 

At the 4th session of the OBIS Steering Group (SG-OBIS-IV, Feb 2015), it was recommended that GBIF should harvest OBIS tier 2 nodes if OBIS tier 2 nodes could also harvest marine datasets from their GBIF nodes. In this way OBIS could work directly with the entire marine community and promote its standards and best practices. It was not recommended that iOBIS set up a separate IPT for GBIF to harvest, since this would mean a duplication of effort.
